# Small Commerical Agency Work

## Agency Archetype Approach
- Approach:
  - What’s next for the agent portal is around the corner and the Small Commercial Digital team is exploring a more personalized experience. To create a space that caters to various roles, we had to deeply understand who agency roles are through interviews and reviewing existing research.
- Defining Archetypes:
  - An archetype is a model that focuses on the behaviors, patterns, and responsibilities of users. We use user behavior to create stories and customer journeys to understand the user and their motivations.
- Who the Small Commercial Agency Archetypes are:
  - Leader
  - Client-oriented 
  - Bookkeeper 
  - Supporter 
  - Company Service Agent
- Why Archetypes:
  - Creating archetypes allows us to visualize our findings and analyze various responsibilities and tasks in a mid-sized agency. Due to heavy involvements of company service agents, involving secondary users will scope how the agency portal should evolve. 

## Agency Archetype Overview

  - This role’s duties vary based on the size of the agency. Typically they make important business focused decisions, such as quoting & issuing. Leaders may take on various roles within the agency. 
- Client-oriented 
  - This role bridges the agency and the company. Client-oriented are the main point of communication for agencies and customers. For example, selling insurance, processing quotes, various system tasks and overseeing other roles like Supporting roles.
